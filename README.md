In the realm of ‘Synesthesia’, each touch unravels a tale not of what is, but of what might cease to be. This interactive odyssey through homemade terrazzo landscapes, embedded with diverse materials, is a meditation on the transient nature of our physical world.

As you navigate this tableau, your touch brings to life the silent stories of each material, now singing through AI-crafted soundscapes. These sounds, which emerge from the mixture of four keywords of opposite character, are not just melodies, but echoes from a future where these materials may no longer exist.
